I recently revisited a project I had previously pushed to GitHub, but I hadn't included any output screenshots at the time. Upon running the project again, I encountered several errors related to Firebase. All my post history is showing errors when trying to load, and I am unable to delete the past post collections from Firebase. There is a red container displayed in the interface where the posts were previously shown. This section was originally intended to display posts added by other users.
